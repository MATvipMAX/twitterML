1219026734793863169,"There was a fight between two sophomores who were fighting over the same guy, i was bored so I instigated and I guess the guy was also bored cause he did the same, however when the fight started and his gf was losing he jumped in to try and deescalate the situation he was punched"
1219026734793863169,"But expectedly didn‚Äôt stop the fight till the junior was on the floor beaten, bruised and unable to stand up"
1219026734793863169,"There was a fight between a freshman and a Junior girl, a teacher went to stop it but he was watching Netflix at the time and because he didn‚Äôt want to stop he took the computer with him to stop the fight, he impressively didn‚Äôt once drop the computer"

1219026734793863169,"Students were fined for parking in the parking lot because it was teachers only, this lead to students parking at a factory next to the school, this lead to the factory allegedly suing the school"
1219026734793863169,Leading many to believe the school themselves did it because the staff also found it more convenient
1219026734793863169,"It was then soldered again by staff, then immediately soldered open again by students, this repeated several times before it seemingly stuck around as closed, but towards the end of the year it was opened again with no alleged person responsible"
1219026734793863169,"Someone broke the part of the gate that‚Äôs by the train tracks, most students started using this as an exit as it was more convenient due to being right in-front of the two bus stops and also constantly open, it was then soldered closed by staff, then soldered open by students"
1219026734793863169,"They never served detention when we came back for the final month of junior year, mostly because no one cares enough, but partly because most of the staff who would‚Äôve remembered got fired or under investigation for the cover up incident"
1219026734793863169,"They ate their food in the office while being told that they‚Äôll have a 2 week suspension and as of yet undetermined amount of detention for their act starting Monday, unknowingly to the staff we would enter a two week quarantine on Monday which would extend to two years"
1219026734793863169,"Many students were forced to cancel their orders or not allowed to get it, 2 girls didn‚Äôt want their money to be wasted and in exchange of 5 bucks I helped them sneak out to pick up their food, they were caught picking up the food"
1219026734793863169,"When COVID started becoming more prevalent the school started implementing many restrictions such as no longer allowing students to order food, they forgot to tell us"
1219026734793863169,school did nothing because cameras only showed a bunch of kids wearing camouflage and black backpacks jumping the fence and placing security guards there to catch people in the act would be dumb when you can have them just unlock the gate instead
1219026734793863169,"The security guards took up to 20 minutes to unlock the gates to let students leave, this resulted in students jumping the fenece almost everyday"
1219026734793863169,"Someone broke my personal laptop, i yelled at the possible culprits, they cried because I was seen as the nice person in the school and no one had ever seen me feel anything worse than indifferent and people where genuinely scared"

1219026734793863169,Half of the staff had a criminal record
1219026734793863169,"We had a military instructor named minor who was ironically attracted to minors, he was fired"
1219026734793863169,This was entirely given up after three weeks when the vice principal tried to get a girl to sign in as late and she yelled ‚Äúget the fuck away from me you fucking pedophile‚Äù
1219026734793863169,"And because we didn‚Äôt have assigned locations to from up, everyone stood next to their friends essentially taking away the punishment and shaming aspect that it was meant to have"
1219026734793863169,"Senior year they tired to make students show up to formation on time by holding kids in the front of the school till first period and register that they are late to school and attempting to ditch formation, all of my friends including me showed up late"
1219026734793863169,Senior year my friend accidentally brought a hammer and an air soft gun to school without anyone finding out till 2nd period where he tried to take out a notebook but instead he pulled me aside and showed me in disbelief

1219026734793863169,"This was one of the biggest acts of solidarity by the students and was considered to be the first time students started fighting back against the admin in an effort to improve the school, a move that was spearheaded by seniors who had the least to gain by the changes"
1219026734793863169,"Senior year, someone threw an ice cream Sunday at a security guard from the second floor window, everyone saw who it was, no body snitched, the school checked the cameras and saw nothing, it‚Äôs believed a separate student who has access to the main office deleted the footage"
1219026734793863169,"One day everyone came to school and saw bullet holes, shells and bullets scattered around the first floor along with one of the glass doors being shattered, we still don‚Äôt know what happened"
1219026734793863169,There‚Äôs no proof of this but it‚Äôs believed a student had a fist fight with a teacher
1219026734793863169,Casas judged a senior for dating a freshman {which was admittedly weird and concerning) this is funny considering what he did
1219026734793863169,"Casas threw a desk at a window but struggled to pick up a desk, he didn‚Äôt face any repercussions for this but he got placed on paid leave later that year anyway"
1219026734793863169,"Casas would tell my class a lot about his personal life because he liked us, we assumed it was because we were his highest performing class and while that might be partly true, it‚Äôs entirely believed he was attempting to groom 3 female students, I think it‚Äôs a bit of both"
1219026734793863169,"Freshman year, Casas told us about his relationship with the student in hopes of getting dating advice, we didn‚Äôt realize this till much later"
1219026734793863169,Senior year a teacher told a student to go back to their country
1219026734793863169,"The teacher decided to punish this student by having him replace every single notebook by hand, me being petty, I forced him to recreate all the doodles I made too, when I was handed the book back by him I promptly threw it away in front of him"
1219026734793863169,"My senior year an either an 8th grader, a freshman or a sophomore (I can‚Äôt remember which) threw a tantrum and preceded to open several windows and throw things out the window as it was raining, one of these things being my notebook which we were obligated to keep in class"
1219026734793863169,I made a presentation with the intent of harassing a teacher and then presented it to the entire senior class
1219026734793863169,"My school had the tradition of doing nothing on Halloween and letting students do absolutely whatever, a student tired to pirate the conjuring for my class, we ended up accidentally watching cannibal holocaust, this lead to the school banning piracy"
1219026734793863169,Student made a presentation where he accidentally showed porn to the class
1219026734793863169,"@MationMiss @moveable35 Yeah, real mid"
1219026734793863169,I fucking hate the CTA https://t.co/mLGeMdCVvY
1219026734793863169,@slutty_username Okay
1219026734793863169,One of the replacement music teachers told me and another female student ‚Äúto just fuck already‚Äù I still don‚Äôt know what the fuck that was about
1219026734793863169,As he grabbed his things to leave a female student jokingly said ‚Äúbye Mommy‚Äù not realizing what was going on or how badly that comment will age
1219026734793863169,"After Casas was told he was under investigation he had to drop everything and leave the building, he later ran a marathon that day, before he was asked to leave the building he was about to grade my test"
1219026734793863169,"I‚Äôll update the thread if I remember anything else,
If anyone wants me to expand on anything and the answer isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù I‚Äôll answer it to the best of my ability if asked"
1219026734793863169,To quote my friend Jason ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt that mf have COVID?‚Äù
1219026734793863169,"After he was fired he showed up to school demanding his job back, he has just sent the email that morning, leaving many students (including myself) confused having just read that he‚Äôs COVID positive and them seeing him walk past us and give us a pat on the shoulder"
1219026734793863169,"The commandant incident, the commandant of the school tested positive for COVID, he then sent all students and staff an email saying he tested positive, he then started spouting anti vax rhetoric, before denying COVID‚Äôs existence despite having it
He was promptly fired"
1219026734793863169,"Class of 2022 had the highest graduating class in the schools history, and it is believed that our recorded isn‚Äôt going to be beat any time soon"
1219026734793863169,As the class of 2022 was getting ready to graduate there was legitimate concerns about the Marines dropping funding for the school which is where we go most of our money from due to all the recent events and press
1219026734793863169,Allegedly
1219026734793863169,"A video of a super senior having sexual relations with a minor surfaced on another school gossip gimmick account, this video was reported to a teacher who reported it to the admin, unsurprisingly they covered it up"
1219026734793863169,"Another friend stole a door handle from a teacher, he returned it to the teacher at the end of the year as a graduation present"
1219026734793863169,"After the devious lick trend, my friend stole a wet floor sign cause he thought it looked cool, my other friend stole the lock of the only remaining stall door because it just fell off as he tried to use it and he thought it was funny"
1219026734793863169,Devious lick trend resulted in doors being stolen off the third floor men‚Äôs bathroom stall
1219026734793863169,Once the head secretary guard saw that I was the one who refused to exit the bathroom she immediately believed me because ‚Äúlook at him‚Äù

809958983758974976,"@HazeTheFox @SilvySpark @ZombieInternet Everything has a price. You want to live? Something has to die. It's shitty, but it's life. Full of grey areas and so many battles. Who and what you fight is your own choice. I'm not gonna make everyone happy, but I can make my small community happy. Just for a moment (3/3)"
809958983758974976,"@HazeTheFox @SilvySpark @ZombieInternet So the companies are the ones who are keep popping out ideas and slapping her name on them. All in the name of profit. True, people could stop buying her stuff, but she is still going to make money for a long time. (2/?)"
809958983758974976,"@HazeTheFox @SilvySpark @ZombieInternet It's not as black and white or simple as that. From a business perspective, they know she is successful with her ideas. So they are going to keep funding her. She wasn't going to make the Fantastical Beasts movies, but they pushed her too. (1/?)"
809958983758974976,"@SilvySpark @Cat_Food_Feed @HazeTheFox @ZombieInternet No matter what I say, everyone will say I am wrong. I am still fighting the battle in my own way. Why are people making enemies out of allies? A game that gave her money no matter if someone or no one bought it. She already got the money as soon as the started writing the draft."
809958983758974976,"@Cat_Food_Feed @SilvySpark @HazeTheFox @ZombieInternet Sure we could just not buy the game. But she is going to make her money either way. Even if they decided to cancel selling the game and no one bought it, she already got her percentage/ cut of money. We need to put people in power that can stop people like her."
809958983758974976,@Cat_Food_Feed @SilvySpark @HazeTheFox @ZombieInternet what about the billions of dollars in royalties she is still getting from royalties from all the companies? where can we shop and not support her? Somewhere I can get affordable groceries and that covers my insurance for medicine. Not to mention somewhere that isn't miles away.
809958983758974976,"@SilvySpark @HazeTheFox @ZombieInternet By improving, we vote and speak out/ protest. Our voices must be heard or nothing is going to be done about these problems. You have to call government offices, write letters and emails. Boycotting is damn near impossible for her with how many places her greedy hands are in."
809958983758974976,"@HazeTheFox @ZombieInternet @SilvySpark If you are boycotting her products, make sure to boycott the companies that keep giving her royalties. Which includes, but not limited to, Wallmart, Target, Amazon, Kolh's,, any place that sells books, all movie theaters who might release more movies."

809958983758974976,@ElerraGames Its hard to be safe on the internet even when you're not making a target of yourself. It's the world we live in.
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames She tried with safety measures. It was actually twitch that banned the words being used by transphobic haters, but she was blamed for that. I bet even if she had subs only on that they would pay for a sub just to be hateful. Its so sad."
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames Or fame can make it worst. So many famous people and billionaire committed suicide or were murder because of their fame and fortune. Mental illness doesn't care about money. I've been safe, cuz im small, but my community wants me to keep playing it and I enjoy it with them."
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames True. It's just so hard to say right now. I still think people should be able to play what games they want and share that joy with others cuz things are shitty everywhere. Maybe she shouldn't have played it on stream, but what about other streamers?"
809958983758974976,@ElerraGames No one is safe from their own minds and what can feed into it. No one can escape someone who truly wishes them harm and no one can escape depression from taking your life if it gets that dark. Money and fame doesn't solve everything
809958983758974976,@ElerraGames She is human though and it still shows the struggles that others are going through too. She just has a safety net unlike others. She is a symbol and a view of what those people are going through right now. What this hate is doing. Others arent big enough to have that luxury
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames Yeah she is a peice of work. What'd worst is that she only seeing 15% of what the game will make ontop of the billions she is making from any stores. Like, where can you shop that doesn't have her merch? I don't want to support her more but I need to groceries."
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames Ok, let's see it from a business perspective, which she had to due to this being her job. She also has a company that is helping to support her. The charts say it's the top viewed game right now to watch on twitch and she also loves HP. So she is gonna risk it"
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames It's both sides attacking each other. Hell even the Trans community is attacking its self atm. We are divided over a game right now rather than the bigger picture. JK has her hands in so many companies, it's almost impossible to not give money to her."
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames My community knows who I am and what I stand for. They know I don't support jk and what she does but i do know that I just want to bring joy. That's what a streamer does. I may lose followers but so be it. They know I care for them, even though we are few."
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames She barely made anything from this game. Even if this game wasn't made, she is still making money. This is just a drop in the bucket. I am doing my part by voting different laws and people in office. There is only so much we can do. I support my community, but I am only human."
809958983758974976,@ElerraGames Jk got paid her royalty whether the game was a success or flopped. Silver isn't even getting paid to play it. It just makes her happy and knows it makes others happy too. If she really wanted to support JK she would be sponsored by warner bros or advertise more HP merch
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames Just because someone likes the brand doesn't mean they agree with the creator. It's not that black and white. for example, I love micheal Jackson's music but I really disliked him as person."
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames I know I'm not the only one. There are other games I could play, sure. But with my head the way it is, it's not that simple and others struggle as well. I don't like jk or agree with anything about her, but everyone had their own battles and how they deal with them"
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames Let me tell you this. This is the ONLY harry potter thing I have ever bought. I struggle with depression, anxiety, stress and other things I will not get into. This game is one of the VERY few things that make me happy and I'm not the only one. It also want to share that feeling-"
809958983758974976,@ElerraGames Very true. She will be fine. But others won't OVER A GAME. None of us should have to stop sharing our joys with people just because others aren't happy with the creators of it. Smaller streamers are getting hit like her too. What's happening to her is what's happening to them.
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames That is true but that still doesn't solve the issue of wanting to play a game to just enjoy a game with viewers. Why should we have to stop playing them? The bigger picture is that if we give into the hate, they win. Simple as that"
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames What proof do you have that she is not being doxxed? I'm sorry but it doesn't matter how many new followers you have. Death threats and getting your personal information stolen by complete strangers is still going to make you scared and, yeah, cry cuz someone might wish you harm."
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames There are other transphobic people who make video games all the time. She is just one of the big name people we are actually aware of. What do you suppose we do to stop the problem? Sure,Silver shouldn't have done what did knowing the risks, but what about the long term solution?"
809958983758974976,@ElerraGames At least she was brave enough to show the harm that is being done to people simply wanting to play a game. Others are just shutting down and some of quit being streamers. I've been hearing so many stories of people being bullied to the point the stop their stream
809958983758974976,@ElerraGames Everyone is getting hurt atm with what's going on. It's hate fueling hate. You are stil missing the point of how both sides are doing terrible things over A GAME. It get as bad as people wanting to cause physical harm to streamers or plan thoughts of suicide.
809958983758974976,@GaruOogami It's ok. I have associates for graphic design and illustration and yet making stuff for myself is the hardest thing.
809958983758974976,@MKH13Omasters Truly a sad moment. He kept his promise though. I'm gonna have to play the game again.
809958983758974976,"@EnjoHisaki How you alive right now? I mean, eating is a plus xp"
809958983758974976,@EnjoHisaki Still so freaking adorable ‚ô•
809958983758974976,@ElerraGames plus she wasnt even involved. they just payed for the world https://t.co/VuA8GY7VN1
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames she is barely making anything from this game, if you have done any research. Nintendo, any kind of book store, legos, universal studios, warner bros, amazon, hot topic, walmart, target, macy's, the list goes on with the royalties she makes from those companies"
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames I decided to stream it and continue to do so, even though I know the risks, cuz I won't let bullies control my life. What I do makes others happy during dark times. That's why I'm a streamer. The risks out weight the good."
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames If someone doesn't support that person for playing that game, don't watch them or support them. But also don't go so far as to verbally assault them. That's not how problems are solved. She isn't the only one who is being bulled threatened, and doxxed. It's bigger than just her."
809958983758974976,"@ElerraGames The problem lies I the fact that people are taking their hate out on someone playing a freaking game. How is this different than if I made harry potter merch, that made me happy and others happy then sold it on my platform only to get bullied after."
809958983758974976,@LitleMiss_Vamp you know how i am with assasin's creed XD i get distracted so easily. maybe ill try genshin but im scared for my wallet &gt;&gt;
809958983758974976,@WulfGrimTV true. i think ill push stream off untill next week either way. would hate to start stream then feel like crap after x.x
809958983758974976,@LitleMiss_Vamp not sure what kind of game that would be lol and i hate being quiet on stream. I try my best to keep talking. even if its dumb stuff XP any game suggestions?

999031348580012032,@kitty_kat_nikki Have you talked to a doctor/psychiatrist about it?
999031348580012032,"@kitty_kat_nikki I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 17, but my symptoms were so extreme that I didn't believe the doctor. It wasn't till years later that I got a diagnosis that made sense."
999031348580012032,"I started expressing symptoms of bipolar disorder with psychotic features when I was 17, but I was not fully diagnosed with the condition until I was 24. Those years were full of confusion and disorientation, and an earlier diagnosis would have saved me from so much stress."

999031348580012032,@Theholisticpsyc Being assaulted as a child by a peer who later went on to tell my parents about the incident as a way to trigger my suicide so that he could cover his tracks. It's impossible for a dead person to report anything to the police. He knew this.
999031348580012032,@ragingstormz @ComputerMadeMe Hahahaha probably. Spewing immoral and fascist talking points this quickly? Bahahahaha like a fascist bot.
999031348580012032,@ComputerMadeMe @ragingstormz It's okay to take moral stances in the face of immoral and unethical decisions.
999031348580012032,@ComputerMadeMe @ragingstormz The Nazis did what they did because they were protected by their own legal system.
999031348580012032,@ComputerMadeMe @ragingstormz He's a murderer. Legality be damned.
999031348580012032,@ComputerMadeMe @ragingstormz And it's completely alright to disagree with an immoral and unethical (yet legal) ruling.

999031348580012032,@ComputerMadeMe @ragingstormz I went over publically available case precedings. Still murder.
999031348580012032,"@ragingstormz @ComputerMadeMe He killed not once, but twice. Twice is multiple times. We can call that mass murder."

999031348580012032,That picture of a rosy-cheeked mass murderer Kyle Rittenhouse is demonic. I can't look at it without wanting to throw my phone across the room.
999031348580012032,"@ragingstormz I keep to myself a lot and hide in books. I've read a book a week since getting sober and want to keep that up. But the more alert I feel, the sadder I get by everything that's going on all over the world. But that's a trick and a trap. Hopeful optimism is key."
999031348580012032,"@ragingstormz Without alcohol, who do you want to be? I ask myself that question every day."
999031348580012032,"@ragingstormz Congratulations for fighting the good fight and working to maintain sobriety! That's awesome, even though you must experience challenging and testing days. You got this!"
999031348580012032,"@ragingstormz I've been sober since December 16th now and that feels like ages. I originally started drinking as a culmination of mental health symptoms I started expressing as a result of years of ""SA"" experienced as a teenager. Sobriety now is making me face that pain without a crutch."
999031348580012032,"I recently became sober after nine years on the bottle, and I'm currently mourning all those lost years. That grief and guilt, I know, will fade in time and change into hopeful optimism. Keep me in your thoughts, friends, for sobriety is no easy feat."

999031348580012032,I have truly never healed from that time in my life (I was 17) and I'm 30 now. How does something that happened 13 years ago still affect me this badly?
999031348580012032,"He did everything in his power to cover his tracks, so he had people post on my social media that I should kill myself. When I started showing signs of major depression from that, he outed me to the public and my religious family, knowing that I would self-harm from that."
999031348580012032,"This kid who outed me to the public had been abusing me for years and knew that outing me would keep me from speaking out anymore. I told some of my friends about the abuse, and he found out that and panicked."

38361129,@sffcorgi @EHUSMAN @SeanMastersons Technically the first accident was when his dad said ‚Äúnaw baby I‚Äôll pull out don‚Äôt worry‚Äù.
38361129,@Pellaeon112 Oh how did I miss this cunning retort.
38361129,@FactApparatchik @LadyBleach @robintran04 Except white men of course.
38361129,"@FeministHellcat That feels like an option you would request tho. Like screw upsetting a bigot getting that box, what if someone gets hate crimed because the bigot across they street thinks you‚Äôre LGBT+ when that box shows up on your property"
38361129,"@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists Odd twitter hid this reply, I didn't even get a notification. 
Anyway nice job completely missing the point of the post you replied to and somehow making it about trans people instead of my misdiagnosed ADHD."
38361129,"@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists Again, no it cant. You might be projecting your own on to others then, maybe see an actual specialist about that."
38361129,"@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists No, depression can be assumed unless you've developed mind reading abilities you cant tell."
38361129,@rasimoko @ElijahSchaffer Theyd get a refund?
38361129,I feel cheated I just ordered from Amazon and got regular brown packing tape. Did you have to request that option?
38361129,@ElijahSchaffer I feel cheated I just ordered from Amazon and got regular brown packing tape. Did you have to request that option?
38361129,"@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists No you cant, you just said you aren't qualified to diagnose things, and if you aren't qualified you're just going by feelings."
38361129,@ShadowShinobiX @ausue82 @AshleyGWinter The people are allowed to make personal decisions agenda? Thought that was yalls bag.
38361129,@ausue82 @AshleyGWinter Why do you care?
38361129,"@_celia_bedelia_ @catturd2 He knows we still have a lot of that stuff right? Of course its harder to skateboard because boomers banned it pretty much everywhere. And my boomer HOA wont allow bonfires, or loud cars, or loud music."
38361129,@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists 25 years later and I still have someone talking over me. Cool.
38361129,"@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists So you just go by your feelings, about what I figured. 

Oooo let me guess, you can always tell when someone is trans too right?"
38361129,@dreamer_doer_7 @EMichaelJones1 Probably pointed out an antisemite.
38361129,@urmomsahobro Yea then I think about how I bought that robot to clean my floor because I have so little free time I was willing to pay 19% interest to amazon to save 20 min of vacuuming.
38361129,@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists So youre a clinical psychologist then?
38361129,@Stop_This_Evil Why not? If cis men and women can do it why cant trans men and women do it?
38361129,"@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists Autism is less disruptive to Amish societies because they arent as overly structured as ours. Thats why they have ""fewer autists"" not because the criteria is different."
38361129,"@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists Well lets see, at 14 I was diagnosed with depression and put on pills that made me want to kill my self all the while I was questioning how they knew thats what it was from one conversation,
Turns out those symptoms are ADHD and possible a bit of autism But yea adults know better"
38361129,@Kummernuss @LadyJayPersists Also that‚Äôs a Facebook video user interface on that video not tiktok
38361129,"@Kummernuss @LadyJayPersists Weird tiktok kept me entertained, I learned a few things, and got to see the joy of people being who they are."
38361129,@CurstDragon @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 So again you cant have an actual conversation. Does the othering help with the fact that anyone is capable of these things and maybe we should stop letting men think they are entitled to women?
38361129,"@CurstDragon @CenScrutinizr @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 Where did I beg? I just pointed out that you dont read well.
Ive just been over here laughing at you being an idiot."
38361129,@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists Huh adults thinking they know whats best for children with out listening to them is probably why ADHD and Autism were under diagnosed and misdiagnosed for years.
38361129,"@CurstDragon @CenScrutinizr @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 Well I would hope not, everything so far has been so pathetic I was starting to feel sorry for you."
38361129,"@CurstDragon @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 You're fine with othering people then accuse me of operating from the racists playbook. 
That actually totally tracks with what ive seen from you."
38361129,@CurstDragon @CenScrutinizr @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 You have an A game?
38361129,@uncledrunky *Artfully arranges skull collection behind me*
38361129,@CurstDragon @CenScrutinizr @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 Well I see you were saving the good insults for me.
38361129,"@RationalStoic @Mandalorian_Ren @LadyJayPersists You mean like people being able to socialize outside their little bubble and being able to see, oh im not the only one like this and I know what its called?"
38361129,"@CurstDragon @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 How do you know? How do you know teaching him from a young age that its not the end of the world if she says no and to just move on would not of prevented this?
Calling him a psychopath is just othering him."
38361129,"@CurstDragon @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 Him learning how to take rejection wouldnt have helped?
Why not?"
38361129,"@CurstDragon @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 Again for the slow readers.
I said men should learn how to take no for an answer. I had to scroll past a dozen or so stories to find that one specifically because it stuck with me that my cousin has a kid around that age and it could have been her."
38361129,"I guess he didnt mean it on that quote tweet him again thing. 
Ah well another one bites the dust. https://t.co/xsCJ6hLfsA"
38361129,"@CurstDragon @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 So you can just write off a child?
Lets hope you never have to write off one you know."
38361129,"@CoopStoryteller Wait are you gonna get me excommunicated from something im not?
I kinda want to see that one."
38361129,@CurstDragon @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 See these are exactly the kind of response that made me say whats a few dead women if we can coddle men from not feeling shamed.
38361129,"@CoopStoryteller Im no ones ally.
Hell I freely admit Im an asshole. 
I just like telling other assholes to fuck off."
38361129,@CoopStoryteller Well helping men learn that they arent entitled to womens time and attention would be a good start and of course learning how to take no for an answer would help too.
38361129,@CurstDragon @Cactuar_Sage @Pellaeon112 Actually my first response to her was an article of a young girl killed by a coworker she rejected.
38361129,"@CoopStoryteller Just really making up my side of the argument in your head arentcha.
Have fun I think youve gotten enough attention for one day, try taking a nap."
38361129,@EHUSMAN @SeanMastersons Guessing his foot caught it accidentally when he was climbing on to the hood you see him use the steering wheel as a foothold
38361129,Geee wonder what could have brought this to my timeline.
38361129,"@CoopStoryteller Youre blaming past victims and your posts show it. Thats a big part of rape culture, I know this because I actually have women friends and cousins who trust me enough to talk about things like this.
Sorry you don't"
38361129,"@CoopStoryteller Some women do play a part in rape culture, they say dumb things like we need to teach women how to say no."
38361129,@CoopStoryteller @NotEliMonty Again Im not a victim blamer like you so they are far more likely to send you a card.
38361129,"@CoopStoryteller Ok so you didnt read my comments at all.
Not shocking."
38361129,@CoopStoryteller Na the guy blaming women for rape is a far better ally to rapists.
38361129,@CoopStoryteller I wasnt giving advice to women did you miss the part where I sad several times that men need to learn to take no for an answer? Or were you too preoccupied with rape?
38361129,@mtgreenee Its gonna ban circumcisions too right?
38361129,"@NotEliMonty The really weird thing I started off talking about that girl that was KILLED AT WORK because she rejected a full grown adult and reported to management she was uncomfortable.
But sure my wanting guys like that to take no for an answer is getting women raped."
38361129,@NotEliMonty He seems to be really into women being to blame for rape.
